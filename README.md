INTRODUCTION:
Deep learning for computer vision and images have shown incredible
potential. This is the result of adapting the architectures of
convolutional neural networks in deep learning to as many fields as
possible. There are many amazing results that we can achieve with deep
convolutional neural networks starting from image classification,
recognition, localization, object detection, and many more. Image
blurring, deblurring and enhancement is one such amazing feat that we
can achieve with deep learning and convolutional neural networks.
OBJECTIVE:
● Using a Gaussian blur and pixelated blur to anonymize faces in
images,so as to help protect the identity of a person in an
image.
● Our user end application will also leverage the deep learning
technology to get the high resolution images from the
noisy,blurred or low-resolution images using tensorflow.In
simple terms we will deblur your blurred images.
● Using a lossless compression algorithm, either CALIC or JPEG-LS,
for compressing the end result images.
● Develop a user end application to facilitate all the
aforementioned functionalities.
Tools Required:
● Python v2.7 or v3.5+
● OpenCV v2+
● Numpy, Scipy
● Tensorflow/Keras
